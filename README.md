<h1>Trading Game Simulation</h1>
<br>
<hr>
<p>using python made a trading simulation. You draw marbles from a bag (assume itâ€™s random).
The bag contains 10 marbles: 6 green and 4 red.
If you draw a green marble, you win the same amount that you bet.
If you draw a red marble, you lose the amount you bet.
Marbles are replaced into the bag after each round.</p>
